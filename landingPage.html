                <h3>Lord of the Rings <br>
                    By J.R.R. Tolkien</h3>
                <p>This high-fantasy novel is a famous three volume epic. It centers around an all powerful ring forged
                    by the Dark Lord Sauron. For many years the ring is sought after by all likes, but at the start of
                    the novel, it resides in the simple home of the hobbit Bilbo Baggins. Bilbo sets a momentous quest
                    upon his cousin Frodo’s shoulders, tasking him with the journey to Mount Doom to destroy the ring.
                    <br>Tolkein’s world-building is deep and rich. He creates languages in his stories that can even be
                    learned by some of the more devoted readers. It’s not just a story that he’s crafting, but a home.

                <h3>Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone <br>by J.K Rowling</h3>
                <p>Harry Potter and the Sorcerer’s Stone brings readers into a world of magic at Hogwarts School of
                    Witchcraft and Wizardry. On his eleventh birthday, Harry’s magical heritage is brought to light by
                    the bumbling half-giant Hagrid. As he embarks on his new life as a wizard, he finds that there’s
                    more to this news than just learning spells and potions. <br> The Dark Lord Voldemort, who had tried and
                    failed to kill Harry as an infant, is regaining power, and Harry stands in his path.The characters
                    are truly the heart of this book. Harry doesn’t have to be the smartest of his friends in order to
                    be a hero, and he doesn’t even have to be nice all the time. He’s a dynamic character who readers
                    can relate to both as they age and as adults—it’s no wonder that Harry Potter is one of the most
                    popular books of all time. <br>

                <h3>The Lion, the Witch, and the Wardrobe <br>
                    By C.S. Lewis</h3>
                <p>As the first of seven novels in the series The Chronicles of Narnia, this book brings to life the
                    fantastical world of Narnia, a place full of talking animals and magic. The story unfolds when the
                    four Pevensie children are evacuated from England during wartime to stay in the old house of a kind
                    professor. When the youngest child, Lucy, enters a wardrobe to find a vast, snow-filled land, she
                    and her siblings are dragged into a battle of good and evil. <br> This book makes readers feel like
                    magic is right at their fingertips—or right at their wardrobe. This is a novel that speaks directly
                    to the hearts of any kid who ever wished their dog would talk back to them. More than that, as the
                    Pevensies face off a witch, it makes readers feel that, with enough courage, anything is possible.
